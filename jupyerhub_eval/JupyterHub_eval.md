# Evaluation of existing JupyterHubs

We aim to evaluate existing JupyterHubs that serve as front ends to HPC at FZJ and elsewhere along the following lines:

## Usability

- Possible to run many notebook servers per user?
- Possible to run remote kernels?
- Feedback about availability of resources / waiting time etc.?
- Tranparent way to chose resources that are available?

## Documentation

- Are the docs up to date with the system that is offered?
- Are the docs up to date with the Jupyter docs?
- Is there a way of contributing to the docs?
- Is it easy for new Jupyter users to get started just based on what's provided by the centre?

## Stability / Latency

- Stable in productive work?  Error rate?
- Possibility to debug if errors occur?
- Responsive under less than ideal link from personal endpoint to Jupyterhub?

## Possible adaptations by the user:

- Jupyter Plugins / Widgets?
- Define own kernels?
- Use own notebook server?
- Possible to use jupyter-server-proxy?
