# Evaluation of existing JupyterHubs

We aim to evaluate existing JupyterHubs that serve as front ends to HPC at FZJ and elsewhere along the following lines:

## Stability / Latency

- Stable in productive work?  Error rate?
- Possibility to debug if errors occur?
- Responsive under less than ideal link from personal endpoint to Jupyterhub?

## Status reports etc?

- Feedback about availability of resources / waiting time etc.?
- Tranparent way to chose resources that are available soon?

## Possible adaptations by the user:

- Jupyter Plugins / Widgets?
- Define own kernels?
- Use own notebook server?
